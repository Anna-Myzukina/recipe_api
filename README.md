## Description


In this project I was Created models with associations and implement all requested features for users, recipes and favourites. Added authentication as described in requirements.

## Live version

[Find your Recipe](https://morning-ridge-74742.herokuapp.com/)


## Getting started
- [ ] To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

- [ ] Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:create
```

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

## Features

- [ ] The user logs in the app, only by typing the username (a proper authenticated login is not a mandatory requirement, but it is in the nice-to-have list)

- [ ] The user is presented with a list of houses: apartment, house, room, etc.

- [ ] When a user selects a house, detailed information about the house is presented and the possibility add it to favourites

- [ ] The user can access a list of favourite apartments




## Environment:

- [ ] ruby '2.7.0'
- [ ] 'rails', '~> 6.0.3', '>= 6.0.3.1'
* 
##### I recommended to add next gems:

gem 'rails', '~> 6.0.3', '>= 6.0.3.1'
gem 'pg', '>= 0.18', '< 2.0'
gem 'puma', '~> 4.1'
gem 'sass-rails', '>= 6'
gem 'webpacker', '~> 4.0'
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5'
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.7'
gem 'fast_jsonapi'
gem 'bootsnap', '>= 1.4.2', require: false
        
 
 Than use next command in your terminal
 
      $  bundle install
      $  bundle update


## Run tests

- [ ] If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
- [ ] Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails generate rspec:install
```

```
$ rspec
```
